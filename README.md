# M^PI Python Self Study

This is a short, self-study, repository intended to provide a starting point for the
Python training participants will receive at [Math to Power
Industry](https://m2pi.ca).  By working through the notebooks in this repository you should get a feel for the level of programming which will we will be assuming during taught portion of m2pi.

1. You should start by reviewing the [Checkup notebook](./PythonForM2PI.ipynb). This material covers most of the areas of Python we would like you to know. Even if you are familar with everything being covered when reading through, we would like you to look through the exercises and make sure know how to solve them.

2. [Problem1](./Problem1.ipynb) and [Problem2](./Problem2.ipynb). These notebooks contain some longer problems to help you confirm your understanding of the material. They build on the material covered in the checkup and we've included hints to help you get started.

For the taught portion of m2pi we will assume that you have read through the notes and are able to complete the two problem notebooks. This should leave you ready to understand the material on `numpy`, `pandas` and `sklearn` which we will cover during the workshop.
